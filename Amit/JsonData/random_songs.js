    text: "In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need  \r\nWhen the pool of tears beneath my feet floods every newborn seed  \r\nThere's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere  \r\nToiling in the danger and the morals of despair  \r\n  \r\nDon't have the inclination to look back on any mistake  \r\nLike Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break  \r\nIn the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand  \r\nIn every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand  \r\n  \r\nOh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear  \r\nLike criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  \r\nThe sun beams down upon the steps of time to light the way  \r\nTo ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  \r\n  \r\nI gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  \r\nAnd every time I pass that way I'll always hear my name  \r\nThen onward in my journey I come to understand  \r\nThat every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  \r\n  \r\nI have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  \r\nIn the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  \r\nIn the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  \r\nIn the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  \r\n  \r\nI hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  \r\nSometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me  \r\nI am hanging in the balance of the reality of man  \r\nLike every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand\r\n\r\n",
