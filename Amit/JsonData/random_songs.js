      "I never shall forget the day  \r\nI heard my dear old mother say  \r\n\"I'm leaving now the old home dear,  \r\nremember Jack your mother's prayer\".  \r\nShe left me as the golden sun  \r\nbehind the hill top it did hide,  \r\nAnd when I found that she had gone  \r\nI laid my guitar down and cried.  \r\n  \r\nCHORUS  \r\nAnd now she's gone this world is drear,  \r\nI long to have dear mother here,  \r\nShe's gone to join the angels there,  \r\nI'll not forget my mother's prayer.  \r\n  \r\nThe birds were still, no sound was made,  \r\nThe organ sad but sweetly played,  \r\nAs by her side we gathered there,  \r\nOur heads bowed down in silent prayer.  \r\nWe laid here where the fragrant rose  \r\nwas blooming o'er her lonely grave,  \r\nAnd now in answer to her prayer  \r\nI'll meet dear mother some sweet day.  \r\n  \r\nCHORUS  \r\nAnd now she's gone this world is drear,  \r\nI long to have dear mother here,  \r\nShe's gone to join the angels there,  \r\nI'll not forget my mother's prayer\r\n\r\n",

      "Born from silence, silence full of it  \r\nA perfect concert my best friend  \r\nSo much to live for, so much to die for  \r\nIf only my heart had a home  \r\n  \r\nSing what you can't say  \r\nForget what you can't play  \r\nHasten to drown into beautiful eyes  \r\nWalk within my poetry, this dying music  \r\nMy love letter to nobody  \r\n  \r\nNever sigh for better world  \r\nIt's already composed, played and told  \r\nEvery thought the music I write  \r\nEverything a wish for the night  \r\n  \r\nWrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin  \r\nDied for the beauty the one in the garden  \r\nCreated a kingdom, reached for the wisdom  \r\nFailed in becoming a god  \r\n  \r\nNever sigh  \r\n  \r\n\"If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it  \r\nRemember only the verse, songmaker's cry, the one without tears  \r\nFor I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.  \r\nComforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality  \r\nWhere being wanted became a thrill I never knew  \r\nThe sweet piano writing down my life\"  \r\n  \r\n\"Teach me passion for I fear it's gone  \r\nShow me love, hold the lorn  \r\nSo much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me  \r\nI'm sorry  \r\nTime will tell (this bitter farewell)  \r\nI live no more to shame nor me nor you  \r\n  \r\nAnd you, I wish I didn't feel for you anymore\"  \r\n  \r\nA lonely soul, an ocean soul\r\n\r\n",

      "In the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia  \r\nDown in the dark of the Cumberland Mine  \r\nThere's blood on the coal and the miners lie  \r\nIn the roads that never saw sun nor sky.  \r\nIn the roads that never saw sun nor sky.  \r\n  \r\nIn the town of Springhill, you don't sleep easy  \r\nOften the earth will tremble and roar  \r\nWhen the earth is restless, miners die  \r\nBone and blood is the price of coal.  \r\nBone and blood is the price of coal.  \r\n  \r\nIn the town of Springhill, Nova Scotia  \r\nLate in the year of fifty-eight  \r\nDay still comes and the sun still shines  \r\n(But it's) Dark as the grave in the Cumberland mine.  \r\n(But it's) Dark as the grave in the Cumberland mine.  \r\n  \r\nDown at the coal face, miners working  \r\nRattle of the belt and the cutter's blade  \r\nRumble of the rock and the walls closed round  \r\n(The) Living and the dead men two miles down.  \r\n(The) Living and the dead men two miles down.  \r\n  \r\nTwelve men lay two miles from the pit shaft  \r\nTwelve men lay in the dark and sang  \r\nLong hot days in the miners tomb  \r\n(It was) Three feet high and a hundred long.  \r\n(It was) Three feet high and a hundred long.  \r\n  \r\nThree days past and the lamps gave out  \r\nAnd Caleb Rushton got up and and said  \r\nThere?s no more water, or light, or bread  \r\n(So we'll) Live on song and hope instead.  \r\n(So we'll) Live on song and hope instead.  \r\n  \r\nListen for the shouts of the barefaced miners  \r\nListen through the rubble for a rescue team  \r\nSix hundred feet of coal and slag  \r\nHope imprisoned in a three foot seam.  \r\nHope imprisoned in a three foot seam.  \r\n  \r\nEight days passes and some were rescued  \r\nLeaving the dead to lie alone  \r\nThrough all their lives they dug their grave  \r\nTwo miles of earth for a marking stone.  \r\nTwo miles of earth for a marking stone.\r\n\r\n",
